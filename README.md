Exploring Lego Database and trends of colors, parts in a set, themes released etc over time

I have used Jupyter, numpy, Pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for visualization

The data is taken from their official Website https://rebrickable.com/downloads/

Check the project code @ https://github.com/si-sa/lego-project/blob/master/lego-data-exploration.ipynb

All the code written is my own and have used official documentations of pandas and seaborn for any guidance
