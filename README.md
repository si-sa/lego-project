Exploring Lego Database and trends of colors, parts in a set, themes released etc over time

I have used Jupyter, numpy, Pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for visualization

The data is taken from their official Website https://rebrickable.com/downloads/

All the code written is my own and have used official documentations of pandas as seaborn for any guidance
